# Machine Learning Notes

Welcome to my **Machine Learning (ML)** notes repository! This collection is an organized guide and set of examples that I am building to document my learning process in ML. From foundational concepts to advanced algorithms, this repository will serve as both a reference and a learning resource for anyone interested in machine learning.
